How to Build a new CrossWise site

get mediawiki, latest version. Or version 1.22.1 or so.
unzip it into a dir that does php


########################################### CW sources

git clone https://github.com/allan-bonadio/crosswise.git cwdir
# where 'cwdir' is the target dir, maybe like the stage dir.

remove the cwdir/site dir; we'll replace it with git

decompress the MW archive as cwdir/site.

should be under source control:
LocalSettings.php
skins/crosswise/
extensions/everything that's not a capitalizzed name of another module, cw*.php
so somehow make those appear without blowing everything up


########################################### credentials

get a copy of /etc/tactileint from somewhere else
and install it and make it work.  You only need regenMe, then run it.  

########################################### webstuff

Log into fastmail, and add domains for cw/dcw and the stage variations

Add a section to nginx.conf that looks like this:
---------------------
        # cross-wise, with php                                                                                                   
        # cw=crosswise tcw = staging sources  dcw=sources with debug flag turned on                                              
        server {
                listen       80;
                server_name     cw.* dcw.*;
                root   /dvl/crosswise/prod/site;

                # magic incantations for cw                                                                                      
                include /dvl/crosswise/prod/cwServer.nginx.conf;
        }

        # staging for crosswise                                                                                                  
        server {
                listen       80;
                server_name     tcw.* dtcw.*;
                root   /dvl/crosswise/stage/site;

                include /dvl/crosswise/stage/cwServer.nginx.conf;
        }
---------------------

########################################### create CW database
	as in the Installation instructions below


# do these to make the dev database givertake.  Sign in to mysql as root.
# mysql> create database cw_dev default character set utf8;
# mysql> grant all on cw_dev.* to solomon@localhost identified by 'password';
# mysql> grant all on cw_dev.* to cwadmin@localhost identified by 'password';

where solomon and cwadmin are the users and password is the password
and cw_dev is the database name.

########################################### Install MediaWiki at least 1.22

surf to cwdir/site/index.php to start the standard installations (as in mw directions)

Must start with NO LocalSettings.php file!  idex.php will point to the way.

No caching: on

Install: continue...
Done!!  It will download your bran new LocalSettings.php file.  Upload from your workstation Downloads dir to the site dir of the target CW, and make sure index.php works and gets you to the default empty main page for MW.

Now rename it LocalSettings.asGenerated.php


So then you merge it into your existing one, which is under source control.  Don't move this into place yet.

########################################### LocalSettings.php

Now we merge the two LocalSettings.php files.  Sorry there's a lot of mechanism.

toss in a %phpinfo.php file, surf there, proves it works.  If you can't get this to work, the rest is pointless.

Anyway, you can surf to /index.php and it's the MW startup main page.  No CW content yet.


########################################### Load CW content

go get a  CrossWise.xml content file.
	wwa
	pepperf
		cd public_html/cw
		get CrossWise.xml

for a more up to date one use the export utility






########################################### success

You can log in as Allan, or whatever default root account you set for mediawiki.


Get footlog to work - copy footLog into extensions; hack LocalSettings.php to fit.  Should show up as teal bar at bottom of page content.
with footlog - http://dcw/index.php?title=Main_Page
without - http://dcw/index.php?title=Main_Page

Get cw plugin to work - ath this point just loadingwithout error.  Again copy over and hack LocalSettings.php.  No effect on main page.
