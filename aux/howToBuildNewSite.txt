Figure out the LocalSettings.php file, some 3-way diff between santiago's and its original.
toss in a %phpinfo.php file

Anyway, you can surf to /index.php not necessarily /.  OF course %phpinfo.
You can log in as Allan, or whatever default root account you set for mediawiki.

It installs all the plugins but only activates the ones you check on.  So delete the rest:
